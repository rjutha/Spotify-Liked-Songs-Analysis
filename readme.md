# Spotify Liked Songs Analysis - Personal Project
Rahim / rjutha@sfu.ca

This project is currently a work in progress.

## Description
The goal of this project was to use the Spotify API to extract music data about myself and to try and make some conclusions about my musical tastes.
For this project I use the r package [spotifyr](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr) to scrape the data from the API.
Once I get the raw data I clean the data into 2 usable datasets described below.
